                <p>Most likely you'll need to commit a lot more time than you initially thought. Don't let that put you off - - most of 
                   it is fun and not at all like work.

                <h4>Learning Strategies</h4>
                <p>Coming from  a science background? <br> 3-D and 4-D imagination frameworks simply do not work here. You will have to develop 
                    a whole new conceptual framework for learning - - one (or more) that suits you. Good luck !
