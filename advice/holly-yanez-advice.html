            <h1>Hi, my name is Holly and I have some advice for you!</h1>

                <h4>You absolutely CAN do this!</h4>
                <p>So, I’m a Skillcrush student trying to break into the world of tech as a junior web developer. Yay! But I have a secret… I’m not actually “techy”. Like, someone-else-setups-my-new-phone not techy. It’s bad.</p>

                <p>Amazingly though, I have made it this far. I learned HTML, CSS, GIT, Github, coding responsive websites, JavaScript, web design, visual design and branding & identity. Guys! That’s just insane, right? Now, here I am taking this wordpress class. What the what?!?!</p>

                <p>Have I made my share of mistakes along the way? YES!</p>

                <p>Have I asked really stupid questions and mixed up Java with JavaScript? YES!</p>

                <p>Have I messed up my assignment so badly that I didn’t even know how to ask my instructors for help? OH YES!</p>

                <p>But, I just kept moving. One step at a time. That’s all you can do, in any area of life. It’s all hard and confusing, but you just push a little harder and inch forward a little more, bit by bit. One day you’ll look back and find yourself in a place you could have only dreamed of and you’re like, “how did I get here?”.</p>

                <p>Keep your chin up. Keep going… even if you feel like you’re bad at it. You’ll get there. You’ll get good at it, promise.</p>

                <p>XOXO -Holly</p>
