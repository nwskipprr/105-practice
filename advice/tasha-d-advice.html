                <h4>Embrace feeling lost!</h4>         
                    <p>Coding is like learning a new language, so feeling lost and overwhelmed is normal. The best way to learn is to keep making mistakes and learn from them.</p>             
                <h4>Have patience with yourself.</h4>            
                    <p>As you would in learning another language or perhaps an instrument, be patient with the process and know that everything
                    unfamiliar feels challenging and impossible at first.</p>             
                <h4>Know that this is very good for your brain!</h4>               
                    <p>Learning new things is always challenging, but it is VERY good for your brain and keeps your "learning muscles" active, no matter your age!</p>           
                <h4>Ask for help</h4>              
                    <p>There are people out there that have gone through this before.  Ask those people for help or resources, connect with your Slack community, 
                    and ask lots of questions. This also helps others learn, as one of the best ways to keep learning is to teach!</p>
