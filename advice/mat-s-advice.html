                <h4>Ask for help</h4>
                <p>I found a lot of things to be quite complicated and worrying, but I asked for help from intructors and such and they helped me a lot.</p>
 
                <p>Also take a break and come back to the issue after a cup of tea and a biscuit.</p>
 
                <h4>Keep going forward</h4>
                <p>Just keep doing it. Keep making step after step and you'll get there.</p>
 
                <p>Failure is just an opportunity to learn how to do something right.</p>
 
                <p>From the greatest failure comes the greatest success.</p>
