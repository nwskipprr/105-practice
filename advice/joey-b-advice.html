                <h4>Have fun with it!</h4>
                <p>The term "coding" can sound so daunting, but I like to treat it as just another hobbie. No matter what your grand plans involving coding includes, you'll always have opporunities to enjoy the quirks and abilities of what
                you learn!</p>

                <p>Nuture your time in the classroom with a sense of curiosity and genuine enjoyment, and the endless goal of learning more and more code seems much more manageable.</p>

                <h4>Balance your struggles</h4>
                <p>At some point(ok, honestly it's going to be MANY points) you'll notice the amount of effort it takes to accomplish a new goal increases; almost to the point where you're hitting a wall. Often times when learning,
                there are many aspects to a new goal or problem. Don't be afraid to switch gears to another aspect when that wall starts to creep up on you. Pushing that tough problem to the back burner not only makes it easier for you,
                but often times approaching that problem with a fresh, clean brain space will make it easier!</p>
