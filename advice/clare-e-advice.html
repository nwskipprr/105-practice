                <h4>Keep Showing Up</h4>
                <p>My professional background (and passion projects!) is in the arts and creativity realm. I've often found it challenging to commit to a regular creative practice, but applying some of those principles to my work on Skillcrush has, I believe, been essential to my continued progress.</p>
 
                <p>Creativity is always with you, but you have to meet her at the door and welcome her in! So much is available to us if we give time, intention, and patience to the process. As I'm learning to code, I simply try to show up every day with what I've got to work with - tired, distracted, frustrated, excited, motivated - whatever I bring to the table is not the point. The point is: I'm at the dang table on the daily!</p>
 
                <h4>Try to ignore the vast, vast world of tech. Just for a minute.</h4>
                <p>Sometimes I feel completely overwhelmed showing up for classes because I realize that what I'm learning is a <em>miniscule</em> fraction of the world of tech. It is too easy to get discouraged if I'm stuck on an HTML link issue when, in the back of my mind, I'm trying to comprehend how the heck I'm ever going to build my own responsive app. One. Thing. At. A. Time.</p>
 
                <p>I'm trying to trust that it'll all build up, and eventually I'll stumble my way into tech-world fluency and confidence!</p>
