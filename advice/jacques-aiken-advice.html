                <h4><span>Consistency</span> is important!</h4>
                <p>When you first start programming you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before. Consistency, therefore, is an important step to heading in the right direction.</p>
 
                <p> Practice coding every day even if it is just for 5 minutes. Small consistent steps every day are better in the long run than trying to practice for longer periods of time. It's easier to retain smaller bits of information.</p>
 
                <h4>Being <span>Confused</span> is okay!</h4>
                <p> When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't quite understand HOW exactly it's doing what it's doing.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
