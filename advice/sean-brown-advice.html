                <h4>Don't get discouraged</h4>
                <p>I would say when you start, don't let anything discourage you.  Yes, this stuff can be complicated, but you are in good hands.</p>

                <p>Your understanding will be built from the ground up.  You will learn the best possible practices that are currently being used in the tech industry.</p>

                <h4>Take notes.</h4>
                <p>I'm not kidding, this is essential to learning a new skill.  If you take notes on your phone or on paper, this is a must especially with all these new terms you will be learning.</p>

                <p>I still refer back to some of my very first notes for a quick brain jogger sometimes.</p>

                <p>You will not regret taking "detailed" notes!</p>
