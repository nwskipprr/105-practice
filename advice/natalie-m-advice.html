                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app, you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and, in the case of software development, it's something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem-solving pursuit that is math and technology, and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going&mdash;clarity awaits.</p>
 
                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology&mdash;whether you are learning to write your first programming language or just the latest framework&mdash;you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and, in fact, it's a critical part.</p>
 
                <p>You see, when you encounter a new programming language, part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code&mdash;even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>Take breaks, but keep coming back.</h4>
                <p>There are going to be moments of overwhelm and doubt. When these pop up, take some deep breaths, offer yourself some self-compassion, and remember to break your big goals down into small, bite-sized pieces. You deserve your own trust and encouragement as you delve into this new realm of problem-solving.</p>

                <p>You got this, you developer, you! And remember: You can do this, but you never have to do it alone.</p>
