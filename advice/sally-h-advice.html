                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
 
                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
                <h4>Look back</h4>
                <p>Don't forget to take the time every once in a while to look back and notice how far you have come since you started. A month ago you knew so much less than you know now! Give yourself a pat on the back . . . you got this!!</p>
                <h4>Sit back and simplify</h4>
                <p>It is so easy to over-think and complicate the processes involved in what you are learning. When you are feeling totally overwhelmed by what you are encountering, <span>STOP</span> take a breath (or two or ten), get a glass of something, pet the dog, cat or goldfish, then sit back down and think "common sense" and "logic" that's what this is all about. If you step aside from the issue for a moment something usually clicks, confusion becomes clarity and you realize the problem was (most often) really simple. AHAH! moments feel sooooooo good!!</p>
