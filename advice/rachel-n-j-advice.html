                <h4><i>Be Patient</i> With Yourself &#x231B;</h4>
                <p>You're undertaking a new challenge and things won't always go right.  When things seem to go sideways, take a breathe and trust that you have the resources and the knowledge to correct the issue.</p>
 
                <h4>Make Time <i>Daily</i> &#x1F31E;</h4>
                <p>Learning to code is learning a new language, new patterns of thinking. The easiest way to get these new patterns into your brain is repetition, repetition, repetition. The more frequently you can do it the more natural it will become.</p>

		<h4>Give Yourself Permission to <i>Play</i> &#127912;</h4> 
                <p>When you play you don't things to seriously.  Practice and try new things as you do. I've learned some commands we haven't learned in the course by accidentally typing the wrong command or rather attempting to type a command from memory and being wrong.  Because I was playing though rather than get mad I was able to look back at what I did wrong and be amazed by the discovery of a new command.</p>
 
                <p>Happy coding journey!  I'm sure you'll be amazed by what you create.</p>
