                <h4>How long will it take?</h4>
                <p>Learning to code can be quite a challenge, I know that from experience. When I first started my journey, one of my questions was "How long will it take me to be a job ready developer?" I got super excited about those bootcamps that promise you to get there in 3 months. At the same time, I doubted if <em>I</em> could make it that fast. Or, even if the answer was yes - would I enjoy the journey? Or would it be a stressful experience, rushing towards my goal?</p>
 
                <h4>Value the way more than the goal</h4>
                <p>Over time my questions canged. I got in touch with mastery based learning - the idea, not to learn as quickly as possible, but as profound and sustainable as possible. The question "How long will it take to become a developer?" changed to "How can I became a <em>great</em> developer, no matter how long it takes?" You will always be learning as a developer, that´s for sure. My humble suggestion would be, don´t hurry so much, enjoy your learning adventure, take all the time you need. You will get there, if you don´t stop going, that´s for sure.</p>
