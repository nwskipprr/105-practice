                <h4>Review, review, review!</h4>
                <p>Learning HTML and CSS is much like learning a new language. There are new words to learn. Some words that you already know take on a whole new meaning. Additionally, there are rules in coding just like there are rules in language. </p>
 
                <p>The key is to keep working at it. When you make errors, that's great! Go back and review, review, review! The more you do it, the more practice you get and the more solutions to the problems you will find. HTML and CSS is simply having a vision then problem solving your way to bringing that vision to life.</p>
 
                <h4>Challenge yourself.</h4>
                <p>Creatively speaking, it's a good thing to push yourself into unknown territory. The path least taken is the path of innovation. Of course there will be stumbling blocks when working on a new coding project. Sometimes you'll need to walk away for a bit. When you come back fresh, many things will fall into place!</p>
 
                <p>Pushing your own boundries is also fertile ground for learning. At times there are alternative ways to get the same result. It's good to venture out and discover different options. From there, not only have you found some "work arounds," but you can see more clearly the smoothest path.</p>
 
                <p>Enjoy the journey ... on all projects! Do your best and keep striving for your "finest" creation.</p>
