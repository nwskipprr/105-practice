                   <h3>Small bites</h3>
                    <p>Learn in small steps that don't overwhelm you. Don't try to learn it all at once. Start at some point that feels easy to you, and keep on growing from there.</p>

                    <h3>Take your time</h3>
                    <p>Yes, I also wish I had started years ago, but other things were important, and no-one can change the past. Still, no need to rush now. Enjoy the satisfaction of truly understanding what you are doing and becoming more and more confident in your abilities. Give yourself the time you need, don't compare yourself to others.</p>

                   <h3>Keep calm</h3>
                    <p>I believe that the core of coding is the ability to solve problems. To see the possible solutions, we need a peaceful mind. Breathe deeply, come back to your center, meditate, go for a walk, exercise, sleep and eat well. Do what helps you strengthen your nerves, so you can keep calm â€“ and solve the problem.</p>

                    <h3>Accept what you can't change</h3>
                    <p>We all face difficult situations. Don't waste time on being angry, sad or frustrated about things you can't change. Your feelings only hurt yourself. Instead, see what you can do to deal with said difficult situations. Change what you can.</p>
