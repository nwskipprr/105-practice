                <h4>Consistency is Key!</h4>
                <p>Even when things seem to be going over your head, stick with it! That lightbulb moment may be just around the corner. When you persist through a challenge, you may not know when you'll stunble upon the answer that will connect the dots, but it just may be right under your nose!</p>
                <h4>Break it Down</h4>
                <p>Stay in the moment and focus on taking small, thoughtful steps towards your bigger goal. Practice makes permanent, and taking one sure step at a time is better than rushing through and getting overwhelmed!</p>
