            <h1>Hi, my name is Aimee. My little bit of advice.!</h1>

                <h4>Talking outloud is your Friend!</h4>
                    <p>When you are first starting out you will and probably always run into something you need to slove, figure out why something isn't working. I have found that talking to myself outloud and actually hearing the question or idea's with my ears helps spark the path to solving the issue or confusion. You will feel confused, talk it out, outloud!</p>
 
                    <p><span class="style">oh!</span> when you are talking outloud, also use the slack community, think of it a great resource full of help from peers who have been in your exact shoes, instructors there to clarify and check your work, a space to talk about fears, hear about success to spark some motivation when needed. You have support, with the wonderful slack community.</p>
 
                <h4>Take a break, YES take that <em>break</em></h4>
                    <p>Learning something new that is work. Our brains need time to process what we just took in.If you find yourself staring at the screen at a total loss, stand up and walk away from the computer. Engage in a different activity for a little bit, set a timer if you want a nudge to go back to it. I'm sure when you get back to it something will click into place.</p>
 
                    <p>My last piece of advice, take a breath and dive in! You got this!</p>

                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                    <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                    <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                    <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                    <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                    <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
