                <h4>Confusion can be the best teacher.</h4>
                <p>Starting to code can be intimidating. There's a lot to learn and even more to remember.</p>
 
                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It means you're doing something right, and overcoming the problem is best way to learn and remember.</p>
 
                <h4>Problem-solving is underrated.</h4>
                <p>Have a problem that you can't seem to solve? Use all your resources: friends, internet, tutorials, even strangers. Because once you solve the problem once, you'll never have to do it again.</p>
 
                <p>Plus, there's nothing like the feeling of getting something done RIGHT.</p>
