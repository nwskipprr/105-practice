                <h4>Don't beat yourself up!</h4>
                <p>It is completely natural to make mistakes! You're learning something brand new and complicated, you're going to hit some rough patches.</p>

                <p>Just remember that you have an abundance of resources right at your fingertips!  Every great coder is still going to make spelling mistakes are forget that crazy little semi-colon; so are you. It's okay!</p>

                <h4>Take the time to learn from your mistakes.</h4>
                <p>Start by taking the time to do your own trouble-shooting: validate your code, look for spelling and grammar mistakes, re-read the instructions, etc.  If all else fails, look it up and/or ask for help!</p>

                <p>If you need to use someone else's solution, take the time to figure out why their solution worked and your didn't.  Work backwards from the code and make sure you know what each part is doing. Hopefully, this will help you realize why you're code was going a little haywire.</p>

                <p>If you still can't quite figure it out, don't worry! The more you do it the easier all of the little mistakes will be to find and correct.</p>
