              <h2>You Will Get Frustrated</h2>
              <p>It's blunt but it's true. When I first started learning code I thought- this isn't too bad.  Then CSS came along, with it's div's and flexboxes and etc. etc.. There were times when I thought my brain would explode in confusion.  If you get to this point just walk away, sleep on it. Give your brain time to digest all this new and confusing information.  And it will, the brain is a magical little computer.  It takes all that information you just fed it and digests it subconciously, even while you're sleeping. ; )</p>

							<p>So give that brain a rest and come back refreshed (see what I did there?) and I promise things will start clicking.</p>

              <h2>Stay The Course</h2>
              <p>Find yourself making a ton of mistakes? I have to remind myself often that making mistakes is part of the process. It can be hard to remember in the moment but really is the best way to learn. And High-five yourself every now and again. Coding is complex stuff, and you're learning it!! How forking awesome is that.</p>
