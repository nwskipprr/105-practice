                <h4>Making Mistakes=Making Progress!</h4>
                <p>You are just about to finish that stubborn header, nothing was lining up the way it was supposed to, but after hours of scouring the code you found the one little typo that was likely the cause of all of your troubles...  You fix the typo that you've hunted down, save the change, and refresh your site to see...  <strong>nothing has changed!</strong></p>
 
                <p>Does that sound familiar?  If it doesn't, then expect it sometime soon!  It is frustrating, and will make you want to throw things at your monitor(s), but that 3 hours you spent scouring your code was NOT wasted time.  During that three hours, you were revisiting all of the concepts, skills, and probably even searching for new input to find out where the error was.  No, the typo that you found did not fix the header, but it WAS still a typo that needed fixing.  Along the way, you likely discovered several other details that you could fine tune to make your project stand out.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>When in doubt, please shout out.</h4>
                <p>Ask for help!  You are not alone in this adventure.  You might be working from your basement with 11 cats for company, but today's technology does not limit you to asking only those cats for help.  Though, you might want to ask the basement spiders for web advice first, I hear they're experts.</p>
 
                <p>Truthfully, the Slack community and Skillcrush team are there to help and support in so many ways.  Before you destroy a monitor in frustration, reach out to a real person or even 11 real people for advice.  You will not have any trouble finding someone who has been in the same situation, and many will be able to tell you their own stories in detail, because the hunt and solving and finally understanding gives you the best <em>(I can't believe I missed that)</em> sense of accomplishment.</p>
