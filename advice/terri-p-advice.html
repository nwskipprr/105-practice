                <h4>Put in the work!</h4>
                <p><span>Seriously though (and while capri pants seriously don't do anyone any favors, that is a topic for another day!), if you're thinking of starting a new career in tech, you need to</span></p>
                <p><span><strong>dedicate the time</strong>.</span></p>
                <p><span>Stop agonizing over whether you're too old or too young, or too fill-in-the-blank, and just focus.</span></p>
                <p><span>Set up a study schedule and simply dedicate your full attention to what you're learning during that time.</span></p>
                <p><span>Try not to obsess over the enormity of what you're doing outside of that time!</span></p>
                <p><span>I've found that if you restrict your thoughts about learning something new (or doing anything life-changing) to certain times of the day it's a lot less overwhelming.</span></p>
                <p><span>But go all out at study time!</span></p>
                <p><span>Go down those rabbit holes, spend two hours exploring Google fonts (okay, not <em>every</em> time you need to choose a font...).</span></p>
                <p><span>Just give it your all, and then <strong>let go</strong> when study time is up.</span></p>
 
                <h4>Be consistent.</h4>
                <p><span>Make time throughout the week to practice what you've learned.</span></p>
 
                <p><span><strong>Even if it's just a short amount of time</strong>, it makes a big difference in being able to retain new information.</span></p>
 
                <p><span>Life happens, so all the more reason to make time to study whenever possible so that you don't find yourself falling off track and having to start all over because you don't remember what you learned.</span></p>

                <p><span>There's just nothing more frustrating and demotivating than feeling like all the time you put into learning was a waste because you have to go back and relearn it all!</span></p>
    
                <h4>Remember your why.</h4>
                <p><span>As cliche as it sounds, it really does help to remind yourself <strong>why it is important for you</strong> to learn these new skills.</span></p>
                <p><span>So create a vision board, write in your journal, or place a sticky note on your laptop - whatever works for you - to keep your end goal in mind everyday.</span></p>

                <h4>Believe in yourself.</h4>
                <p><span>Learning to code isn't easy, nor does it happen overnight - so <strong>don't be too hard on yourself</strong> if it feels like you aren't making much progress at first.</span></p>
                <p><span>Remember to take breaks anytime you feel stuck on something, and reach out for help when you need it. </span></p>
                <p><span>Turning your thoughts to something else for a bit is more often than not all it takes to allow your mind to solve the problem.</span></p>
                <p><span>If coding is something you enjoy, then it is something you can do!</span></p>
                <p><span>So get back to work and on your path to future you - <em><strong>you got this!</strong></em></span></p>
