                    <p>Just like your first time learning to ride a bike, or drive a car, or flip a pancake in the air and catch it in the pan again (still haven't mastered that one btw), learning to code can be daunting at first, but so worth it in the end. Maybe you're hesitant because you don't know where to start. Or perhaps you started learning on your own and couldn't grasp the concepts. Or maybe you took a class that you just couldn't get anything from. Fret not! There are hundreds, if not thousands of resources to offer knowledge, give tips and support, and make the entire process fun and best of all </br>*u n d e r s t a n d a b l e*.</p> </br></br>
                    <p>My intro to serious coding started with the DIY route. I figured if I could learn it all with out spending very much money, that would be the most beneficial route. However, try reading a manuscript on how to build a rocket (for those of you who actually haven't built a rocket) all by yourself. All the knowledge was there but reading through the lessons on my own just ended up being a race of &quot;Ok, I finished that one, on to the lext lesson&quot; without ever implementing what I'd learned or making sure I actually understood it. I was just reading. So after months of getting no where, and still following step by step the tutorials on how to construct a website from children's books (you read that right and I have no shame lol) I decided to actually search for an instructor, bootcamp, community, basically anyone I could check in with and make sure I was where I needed to be knowledge-wise. And now I'm confidently building html, creating beautiful webpages with css, and navigating my computer through the command line! </p>

                    <p>I myself am only a beginner into the field of tech but I've quickly come to realize there is no such thing as knowing it all. There's so many languages to learn and industry practices are always changing. You'd likely be doing yourself a disservice by choosing not to start until you know absolutely everything. Every coder utlizes cheat sheets. Plenty of coders check the source code from pre-existing web pages and projects to make a spin off. By all means soak up all the knowledge you can, but don't get stuck wanting to remember every HTML tag. The more you code, the more knowledge will naturally come!</p>
