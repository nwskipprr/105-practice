            <h1>Hi, my name is Jamie and I have some advice for you!</h1>

            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>Keep going even if you don't feel like it!</h4>
                <p>When you are first learning these new skills, such as writing code in HTML & CSS, there will be some difficult times. You might get stuck on something, spending hours trying to look up how to fix it, and it just starts to seem impossible. But you have to push through that feeling and those negative thoughts. You can do this!! Just keep trying, keep practicing and eventually you'll get it. I promise.</p>

                <h4>USE SLACK!</h4>
                <p>Seriously... use Slack. When I first started writing code in HTML & CSS I refused to use Slack. I just didn't think it would actually help me. Boy, was I wrong! Eventually, I turned to Slack because I was stuck on a styling problem in CSS and could not figure out how to fix it no matter how long I looked for an answer. So, feeling defeated, I finally went on Slack as my last resort. And there I found hundreds of students, just like me, who were having similar issues.</p>
                <p>I was so happy! It felt so great to see others were stuggling and that I was not alone in needing help. Everybody needs help sometimes. It's a fact of life. So take advantage of Slack and talk with your fellow students and the Skillcrush instructors. It will seriously change your coding game. And don't forget, we learn from our mistakes. So getting stuck, and asking for help will aid you in remembering the solution the next time you find youself facing a similar situation.</p>

                <h4>Don't forget to take breaks.</h4>
                <p>When we are coding or even just working on our course work we are sitting in front of a computer for hours. A lot of times, when working on a project, you kinda get sucked into this black hole and time passes without you even noticing. But you have to remind yourself to take breaks sometimes.</p>
                <p>Get up and walk away from your computer. Take your dog for a walk. Make a cup of coffee. Eat a healthy snack. Do some stretches or yoga. Call a friend. Whatever it is you need to do to remove youself for that "sitting in front of the computer staring at a screen for hours" situation we all find ourselves in. Seriously, taking a break every once in a while will make you feel so much better and you'll come back to your work with a clear mind and the ability to get it done!</p>
