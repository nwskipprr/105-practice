                <h4>Mistakes rock</h4>
                <p> I'm in the process of transferring from marketing into programming. At first, all my mistakes stressed me out (even though they were inevitable for such a newbie.) That's because mistakes in my previous job were seriously frowned upon.</p>
                <p> One of the joys of coding is that every mistake is a lesson, and stops you from doing the same thing again next time. </p>
                <p> So although it feels unnatural, it's time to embrace your errors! </p>
            </div>


        <div class="advice">
          <h4>Little and often</h4>
          <p> You're essentially learning a bunch of new languages, so you can't expect to practice for an hour a week. Or even one full day a week! </p>
          <p> For me, the only way that my new skills stuck in my brain is showing up every single day, even when you don't feel like it.</p>
          <p>Practice makes perfect, after all. </P>
