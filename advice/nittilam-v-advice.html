                <h4>Slow and Steady is the way to <span>slay</span>!</h4>
                <p>As a new coder, one thing I have understood so far is that, you have to be patience with the learning process to be able to truly succeed. We often feel intimidated by the fact that we are learning something new and that so many people are ahead of us in the game, but success is the result of consistency and being patience with yourself. So many things will come along the way of your learning process, but every bug and mistake requires you to solve it by taking baby steps.</p>
 
                <p>The more you take time learning something new and being patient with yourself, the more you will enjoy what you do, because you will feel that the process has been patient with you and that have you been patient with the process. Being slow and steady helps you evolve and learn more about yourself and the new topic or skill you are learning. Believe in learning slowly and steadily!</p>
 
                <h4>Mistakes make you learn</h4>
                <p>Mistakes only lift you up, they never bring you down, the more mistakes you make along the path of coding the more learned you are becoming. So don't be scared of making mistakes, this is the time and everyone makes mistakes! We are always making mistakes, because we don't know everything and by making mistakes we get to know more and become more confident in ourselves and in our skills as coders.</p>
 
                <p>You need to know what doesn't work in order to know what works. It takes a lot of trial and error. And throughout those trials and errors period, believe it or not you are becoming more successful! </p>
 
                <p>You won't know if you don't try. So don't be scared to try and make mistakes, it's all there to change you and make you grow! Slayyyy! </p>
