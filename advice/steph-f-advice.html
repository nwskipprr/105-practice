            <h1>Hello! I'm <span>Steph</span> and I have some advice for you.</h1>

                <h4>Nobody knows what they're doing!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, 
                    something so specific that it's probably never been done before. Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the 
                    problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits</p>
 
                <p>You're going to feel frustrated. And at times, you'll feel like you're the only person in the world that can't figure out how to finish this lesson. I promise you, you are not alone. 
                    Everybody is struggling through this. Everybody is feeling frustrated. So don't be afraid to ask questions, even if you think they're stupid. GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND! Chances are, the people
                    answering your questions are using Google as well.
                </p>
 
                <h4>Set goals for yourself!</h4>
                <p>Setting daily, weekly, or even monthly goals for yourself will help you tackle this new journey. Maybe you decide you want to have this lesson finished by the end of the week. Come up with 
                    a schedule to allow that to happen. Some goals I have set for myself include reading at least one blog post and listening to at least one podcast per week. I also set a goal to finish the 
                    Skillcrush courses in the time frame listed at the top of the class. But make sure you build in some time to decompress and walk away from the computer. If your goals are realistic and 
                    attainable, you will be able to learn this new world with minimal stress!
                </p>

                <h4>Practice makes perfect!</h4>
                <p>You have to practice everything you learn! There are so many resources out there to gain practice. I use the Skillcrush lessons in conjunction with W3 Schools and Codecademy. This allows me to 
                    see and practice what I'm learning more than just what's presented to me in class. The more you practice, the easier this will become.
                </p>

                <h4>Find yourself a network!</h4>
                <p>Don't think you have to do this alone. There are so many people in the same boat as you right now. Reach out. Ask questions. Share answers to problems you've solved. Form study groups
                    and accountability groups. Start projects with your classmates. Go to meetups. Attend conferences. A solid network will prove to be vital in your succes!
