                <h4>Do a little each day!</h4>
                <p>Even if you feel you would like to be moving faster, sometimes life happens. The important thing is that you don't give up and do your best each day. Steady progress will become lots of progress.</p>

                <h4>Rubber duck (or origami butterfly) debugging!</h4>
                <p>One day a friend of mine made me an origami butterfly. That same day a developer-friend told me about the concept behing "rubber duck debugging": basically, when you run into a issue and you have no one to bounce ideas of, try talking out loud to a rubber duck (or, in my case, my origami butterfly) about what you did, what is not working. Sometimes, just this will make you realize what went wrong or a new idea to try might pop up :)</p>
