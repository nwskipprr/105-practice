                <h4>Practice, practice, practice!</h4>
                <p>You <strong>must</strong> be willing to practice your coding skills! Nobody is instantly great at this. The best developers are the best because they've dedicated the time to their craft. If you put in the work, the time and the effort, you'll be successful.</p>
 
                <h4>Rest; don't quit.</h4>
                <p>When it's 2 AM and you've been at it for hours, and your code isn't doing what you want it to do, it's time to take a step back. Go to bed, wake up refreshed, and your brain will likely be able to spot the issue. (...And if not, that's what Stack Overflow is for!)</p>
